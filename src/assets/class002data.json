That mindset has shaped how I approach challenges and motivates me to keep striving for more.",
        "In high school, I was all about coding. I spent my time building websites, competing in hackathons, and thought for sure I’d go into software engineering. But after doing an apprenticeship, I started seeing how technology connects to business in ways I hadn’t thought about before. It made me curious about how businesses operate, how decisions are made, and how I could combine my love for tech with an interest in solving bigger-picture problems. That experience shifted my focus toward the intersection of finance and technology, and I’ve been pursuing it ever since.",

Along the way, I picked up skills I didn’t even know I needed, like using Excel and PowerPoint efficiently, and I got a lot better at communicating and working with others. Now, I’m focused on building a career in financial services where I can solve problems, make an impact, and help create opportunities for others like me."
